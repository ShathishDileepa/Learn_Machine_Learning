# Machine Learning 101 - Zero to Mastery

## In this Repository you can find knowledge regarding..

1. Associative Rule Learning
2. Classification
3. Clustering
4. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
5. Regression
6. Reinforcement Learning

## In order to follow this, Following steps should be followed.

1. Install Miniconda on your computer
2. Go to the directory, where you cloned this repo
3. Open your terminal and type `conda create --prefix ./env matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter`
4. After the env folder is created type `conda activate <Absolute file path to your env folder>`
5. Then after the env is changed from `base` to your env, Type `jupyter notebook` in the terminal, So your prject directory will be opened via jupyter notebook.

## NOTE :

- Make sure to create a `models` folder as well. This folder is not present in this repo. But it is needed to be there for the `Scikit-Learn-Basics-101.ipynb` to run properly.

## Enjoy Machine Learning :)
